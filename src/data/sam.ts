  favorites: {
    'C#': `The .NET ecosystem makes for rapid development of stable applications which will be easy to maintain or even hand off to other teams if necessary. With the advent of Azure Cloud, it's easier than ever to develop cloud based services and APIs.`,
    TypeScript: `Since V8 has revamped the JavaScript world, I've been writing
      applications in JavaScript. I find it to be tons faster and more stable.
      Now that NodeJS has a CLR, it's an excellent platform to write fast and
      responsive cross-platform code. I've written server apps with it, and
      used Electron (and nw.js) to write GUI apps. Strongly typed JavaScript is helps to prevent runtime crashes, and more importantly, helps reduce tribal knowledge by increasing self-documenting code.`,
    'C++': `C++ was my first programming language, and I still very much enjoy it. It's usually only helpful for niche projects or applications. However, when you need more control or hyper-efficiency with memory or speed, C++ will be your friend.`,
